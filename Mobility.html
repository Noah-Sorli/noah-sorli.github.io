		  <h2> Known Foreign Language</h2>
			<h3>English  <img src="https://flagcdn.com/gb.svg" width="20" alt="UK flag">/ <img src="https://flagcdn.com/us.svg" width="20" alt="USA flag"></h3>
			<p>I completed a high school diploma with a European section in English, which allowed me to strengthen both my written and spoken skills. I also spent three weeks in Montana, USA, in a local high school as part of a full immersion program. This experience not only helped me improve my fluency but also made me discover and deeply appreciate American culture and daily life. Since then, English has become an essential part of both my studies and my personal interests, and I keep practicing it regularly through courses, media, and conversations.</p>
		  <h3>Spanish  	<img src="https://flagcdn.com/es.svg" width="20" alt="Spanish flag"></h3>
		  <p>I have family living in Andalusia, and I spent several weeks there during my childhood, fully immersed in the local culture and language. These experiences allowed me to develop a natural ease with spoken Spanish and a strong appreciation for Andalusian traditions, lifestyle, and warmth. I truly enjoy practicing Spanish whenever I get the opportunity, whether through travel, conversation, or media.</p>
		  <h3>Russian  <img src="https://flagcdn.com/ru.svg" width="20" alt="Spanish flag"></h3>
		  <p>I have always been fascinated—almost unexpectedly—by the Russian language and culture. A few years ago, I started learning it on my own, driven by curiosity and the desire to explore something very different. Since I already had a solid foundation in Spanish, I decided to take advantage of the opportunity offered by ENSEEIHT to study Russian more seriously. It is both a linguistic and cultural challenge that I truly enjoy, and I look forward to improving my level in the coming years.</p>

		<h2>Projects</h2>
		<div>
			<h3> Double Diploma in Canada (differents options)</h3>	
			<p>I recently attended the presentation day of Quebec engineering schools, which truly strengthened my desire to study there. I have always been attracted by North American culture and its dynamic approach to innovation and research. Pursuing a double degree in Canada would be a unique opportunity to experience this environment firsthand while continuing to develop my engineering expertise.
			<br><br>
			Several partner institutions, such as <a href="https://www.polymtl.ca" class="lien-propre">Montréal Polytechnic School</a>, <a href="https://www.uqac.ca" class="lien-propre">Chicoutimi Québec University</a>, and <a href="https://www.etsmtl.ca" class="lien-propre">ETS</a>, offer appealing programs that combine academic excellence with strong connections to the professional world. Some even provide pathways to doctoral studies or post-graduation employment opportunities in Canada, making this project particularly motivating for me.
			</p>
			<h3>Double Diploma in Madrid Polytechnic school</h3>
			<p>Choosing to pursue a double degree at the <a href="https://www.upm.es" class="lien-propre">Polytechnic University of Madrid</a> would be an excellent opportunity to combine academic excellence with cultural enrichment. Spain has always been close to my heart, studying in Madrid would therefore allow me to strengthen my Spanish skills while continuing my engineering education in a renowned institution.
			<br><br>
			The university’s strong reputation in both research and engineering makes it an attractive option for international students. This experience would not only broaden my technical and cultural horizons but also provide valuable connections within the European engineering community.</p>
			
			<h3>Free Mover exchange in Russian Federation</h3>
			<p>Among the examples of free mover programs listed by ENSEEIHT, I discovered the <a href="https://spbti.ru" class="lien-propre"> Saint Petersburg State Institute of Technology</a> and the <a href="https://www.rusvuz.com" class="lien-propre"> Siberian State Aerospace University</a>. Both institutions immediately caught my attention, as studying there would represent a more ambitious and immersive project.
			<br><br>
			I have always been passionate about space and aerospace engineering, and Russia remains one of the most historically significant nations in this field. From early space exploration to cutting-edge research, its contribution to science and technology has always fascinated me. A mobility experience in Russia would therefore be a unique opportunity to explore a new academic and cultural environment while deepening my understanding of a domain that truly inspires me.</p>
